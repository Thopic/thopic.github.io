  abstract = {In this work we extend the results of the reunion probability of {$\mathsl{N}$}NN one-dimensional random walkers to include mixed boundary conditions between their trajectories. The level of the mixture is controlled by a parameter {$\mathsl{c}$}cc, which can be varied from {$\mathsl{c}$}=0c=0c=0 (independent walkers) to {$\mathsl{c}\rightarrow\infty$}c\textrightarrow{$\infty$}c\textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash infty (vicious walkers). The expressions are derived by using Quantum Mechanics formalism (QMf) which allows us to map this problem into a Lieb-Liniger gas (LLg) of {$\mathsl{N}$}NN one-dimensional particles. We use Bethe ansatz and Gaudin's conjecture to obtain the normalized wave-functions and use this information to construct the propagator. As it is well-known, depending on the boundary conditions imposed at the endpoints of a line segment, the statistics of the maximum heights of the reunited trajectories have some connections with different ensembles in Random Matrix Theory. Here we seek to extend those results and consider four models: absorbing, periodic, reflecting, and mixed. In all four cases, the probability that the maximum height is less or equal than {$\mathsl{L}$}LL takes the form {$\mathsl{F}\mathsl{N}$}({$\mathsl{L}$})={$\mathsl{A}\mathsl{N}\sum\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}\in\Omega$}Be-{$\sum\mathsl{N}\mathsl{j}$}=1{$\mathsl{k}$}2{$\mathsl{j}$}{$\mathsl{N}$}({$\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}$})FN(L)=AN{$\sum$}kk{$\in\Omega$}Be-{$\sum$}j=1Nkj2VN(kk)F\_N(L)=A\_N\textbackslash sum \_\{\textbackslash varvec\{k\}\textbackslash in \textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash text \{B\}\}\} \textbackslash mathrm\{e\}\^\{-\textbackslash sum \_\{j=1\}\^Nk\_j\^2\}\textbackslash mathcal \{V\}\_N(\textbackslash varvec\{k\}), where {$\mathsl{A}\mathsl{N}$}ANA\_N is a normalization constant, {$\mathsl{N}$}({$\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}$})VN(kk)\textbackslash mathcal \{V\}\_N(\textbackslash varvec\{k\}) contains a deformed and weighted Vandermonde determinant, and {$\Omega$}B{$\Omega$}B\textbackslash Omega \_\{\textbackslash text \{B\}\} is the solution set of quasi-momenta {$\mathsl{k}\mathsl{k}$}kk\textbackslash varvec\{k\} obeying the Bethe equations for that particular boundary condition.},

We estimate the probabilities of a rescue recombination of the {$\beta$} chain on the second chromosome upon failure or success on the first chromosome. Unlike {$\beta$} chains, {$\alpha$} chains recombine simultaneously on both chromosomes, resulting in correlated statistics of the two genes which we predict using a mechanistic model. We find that {$\sim$}35\% of cells express both {$\alpha$} chains. Altogether, our statistical analysis gives a complete quantitative mechanistic picture that results in the observed correlations in the generative process. We learn that the probability to generate any TCR{$\alpha\beta$} is lower than 10-12 and estimate the generation diversity and sharing properties of the {$\alpha\beta$} TCR repertoire.},

We present "Immprint," a classifier using an information-theoretic measure of repertoire similarity to distinguish pairs of repertoire samples coming from the same versus different individuals. Using published T-cell receptor repertoires and statistical modeling, we tested its ability to identify individuals with great accuracy, including identical twins, by computing false positive and false negative rates {$<$} 10-6 from samples composed of 10,000 T-cells. We verified through longitudinal datasets that the method is robust to acute infections and that the immune fingerprint is stable for at least three years.

We introduce a family of three-point correlation functions which probe the imaginary Liouville component, and we use transfer-matrix numerical diagonalisation to compute finite-size estimates. We obtain good agreement with our analytical predictions for the universal amplitudes and spatial dependence of these correlation functions. Finally we conjecture that this relation between non-intersecting loop models and the imaginary Liouville theory is in fact quite generic. We give numerical evidence that this relation indeed holds for various loop models.},

The tissue origin, regenerative capacities, and differentiation pathways of TIL subpopulations remain poorly understood. Using a combination of single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, we investigate the functional organization of TIL populations in primary NSCLC. We identify two CD8+ TIL subpopulations expressing memory-like gene modules: one is also present in blood (circulating precursors) and the other one in juxtatumor tissue (tissue-resident precursors). In tumors, these two precursor populations converge through a unique transitional state into terminally differentiated cells, often referred to as dysfunctional or exhausted. Differentiation is associated with TCR expansion, and transition from precursor to late-differentiated states correlates with intratumor T cell cycling. These results provide a coherent working model for TIL origin, ontogeny, and functional organization in primary NSCLC.},

  abstract = {The Omicron BA.1 variant emerged in late 2021 and quickly spread across the world. Compared to the earlier SARS-CoV-2 variants, BA.1 has many mutations, some of which are known to enable antibody escape. Many of these antibody-escape mutations individually decrease the spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) affinity for ACE2, but BA.1 still binds ACE2 with high affinity. The fitness and evolution of the BA.1 lineage is therefore driven by the combined effects of numerous mutations. Here, we systematically map the epistatic interactions between the 15 mutations in the RBD of BA.1 relative to the Wuhan Hu-1 strain. Specifically, we measure the ACE2 affinity of all possible combinations of these 15 mutations (215\,=\,32,768 genotypes), spanning all possible evolutionary intermediates from the ancestral Wuhan Hu-1 strain to BA.1. We find that immune escape mutations in BA.1 individually reduce ACE2 affinity but are compensated by epistatic interactions with other affinity-enhancing mutations, including Q498R and N501Y. Thus, the ability of BA.1 to evade immunity while maintaining ACE2 affinity is contingent on acquiring multiple interacting mutations. Our results implicate compensatory epistasis as a key factor driving substantial evolutionary change for SARS-CoV-2 and are consistent with Omicron BA.1 arising from a chronic infection.},

  abstract = {The Omicron BA.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2 escapes convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies that are effective against earlier strains of the virus. This immune evasion is largely a consequence of mutations in the BA.1 receptor binding domain (RBD), the major antigenic target of SARS-CoV-2. Previous studies have identified several key RBD mutations leading to escape from most antibodies. However, little is known about how these escape mutations interact with each other and with other mutations in the RBD. Here, we systematically map these interactions by measuring the binding affinity of all possible combinations of these 15 RBD mutations (215=32,768 genotypes) to 4 monoclonal antibodies (LY-CoV016, LY-CoV555, REGN10987, and S309) with distinct epitopes. We find that BA.1 can lose affinity to diverse antibodies by acquiring a few large-effect mutations and can reduce affinity to others through several small-effect mutations. However, our results also reveal alternative pathways to antibody escape that does not include every large-effect mutation. Moreover, epistatic interactions are shown to constrain affinity decline in S309 but only modestly shape the affinity landscapes of other antibodies. Together with previous work on the ACE2 affinity landscape, our results suggest that the escape of each antibody is mediated by distinct groups of mutations, whose deleterious effects on ACE2 affinity are compensated by another distinct group of mutations (most notably Q498R and N501Y).},

Structural and biochemical characterization of these bnAbs has provided molecular insight into how they bind distinct antigens. However, our understanding of the evolutionary pathways leading to bnAbs, and thus how best to elicit them, remains limited. Here, we measure equilibrium dissociation constants of combinatorially complete mutational libraries for two naturally isolated influenza bnAbs (CR9114, 16 heavy-chain mutations; CR6261, 11 heavy-chain mutations), reconstructing all possible evolutionary intermediates back to the unmutated germline sequences. We find that these two libraries exhibit strikingly different patterns of breadth: while many variants of CR6261 display moderate affinity to diverse antigens, those of CR9114 display appreciable affinity only in specific, nested combinations. By examining the extensive pairwise and higher order epistasis between mutations, we find key sites with strong synergistic interactions that are highly similar across antigens for CR6261 and different for CR9114. Together, these features of the binding affinity landscapes strongly favor sequential acquisition of affinity to diverse antigens for CR9114, while the acquisition of breadth to more similar antigens for CR6261 is less constrained. These results, if generalizable to other bnAbs, may explain the molecular basis for the widespread observation that sequential exposure favors greater breadth, and such mechanistic insight will be essential for predicting and eliciting broadly protective immune responses.},

  abstract = {Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that neutralize diverse variants of a particular virus are of considerable therapeutic interest. Recent advances have enabled us to isolate and engineer these antibodies as therapeutics, but eliciting them through vaccination remains challenging, in part due to our limited understanding of how antibodies evolve breadth. Here, we analyze the landscape by which an anti-influenza receptor binding site (RBS) bnAb, CH65, evolved broad affinity to diverse H1 influenza strains. We do this by generating an antibody library of all possible evolutionary intermediates between the unmutated common ancestor (UCA) and the affinity-matured CH65 antibody and measure the affinity of each intermediate to three distinct H1 antigens. We find that affinity to each antigen requires a specific set of mutations \textendash{} distributed across the variable light and heavy chains \textendash{} that interact non-additively (i.e., epistatically). These sets of mutations form a hierarchical pattern across the antigens, with increasingly divergent antigens requiring additional epistatic mutations beyond those required to bind less divergent antigens. We investigate the underlying biochemical and structural basis for these hierarchical sets of epistatic mutations and find that epistasis between heavy chain mutations and a mutation in the light chain at the VH-VL interface is essential for binding a divergent H1. Collectively, this is the first work to comprehensively characterize epistasis between heavy and light chain mutations and shows that such interactions are both strong and widespread. Together with our previous study analyzing a different class of anti-influenza antibodies, our results implicate epistasis as a general feature of antibody sequence-affinity landscapes that can potentiate and constrain the evolution of breadth.},

We introduce a new software tool SONIA to facilitate inference of individual-specific computational models for the generation and selection of the TCR beta chain (TRB) from sequenced repertoires of 651 individuals, separating and quantifying the variability of the two processes of generation and selection in the population. We find not only that most of the variability is driven by the VDJ generation process, but there is a large degree of consistency between individuals with the inter-individual variance of repertoires being about {$\sim$}2\% of the intra-individual variance.
